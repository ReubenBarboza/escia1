INTRO:In 1981, Intel introduced an 8-bit microcontroller called the 8051. It was referred as system on a chip because it had 128 bytes of  chip data RAM, 4KB of on-chip ROM, two timers, one serial port, and 4 ports (8-bit wide), all on a single chip.

It has been 39 years since Intel introduced this microcontroller and technology has since progressed immensely.For example ,take the Arduino- a project started at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy and thereafter prepared the first Arduino by 2005.Since then,the Arduino has become the number one choice for electronics makers, especially for developing solutions for the IoT marketplace, which has been predicted to become a $6 trillion market by 2021.

Advantages of Arduino over 8051 Mircrocontroller:
src:https://www.engineersgarage.com/knowledge_share/arduino-vs-microcontrollers/
1)Arduino can handle voltage touching 20V whereas 8051 can handle only till 6.6V
2)Arduino has flash memory of 32KB whereas 8051 microcontroller has only 8KB
3)The clock speed of Arduino can be increased to 20Mhz from 16Mhz while 8051 had a fixed clock speed of 12Mhz
4)One important characteristic of the Arduino over 8051 is that its user-friendly and does not require profound knowledge of its internal architecture like we need it in 8051.
5)Arduino has 14 digital I/O pins whereas 8051 has 32 pins making it more bulky and susceptible to damage.

How could 8051 improve?
1)Converting 8051 from CISC architecture to RISC would make it more cost efficient and have a faster processing power.
2)Having it programmable by high level langauges like python would be a step in the right direction away from hard to read assembly code.
3)Adding more attention towards building development kits and providing support for them would ease the development process tremendously. 

My thoughts:
1)8051 had a really good place in many people's hearts including mine but I do feel that it is a little outdated and its time is up.8051 was the first microcontroller I was taught which does make it considerably easier to learn others like the Arduino.
2)In place of 8051, I would prefer using the later versions of Arduino or Raspberry pie as they are much more versatile and user-friendly.

Conclusion:
As long as mankind innovates there will always be a better technology awaiting us. We just have to think that the past lacked what we have now and the future will have something we can innovate now.
